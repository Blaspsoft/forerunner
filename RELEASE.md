# Release Guide

This document outlines the steps to create releases for the Forerunner package.

## Initial Pre-release (0.1.0) - Current

Starting with v0.1.0 gives us room to iterate with 0.2.0, 0.3.0, etc. before the stable 1.0.0 launch.

### Steps to Create Pre-release

1. **Commit all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare v0.1.0 initial pre-release

   - Add advanced JSON Schema features
   - Add helper methods for common formats
   - Add comprehensive documentation
   - Add 31 new tests for advanced features"
   ```

2. **Create and push the tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial pre-release v0.1.0

   This is the initial pre-release. Expect updates as we iterate towards 1.0.0.

   New Features:
   - additionalProperties support with strict() helper
   - format validation (email, url, uuid, date-time, etc.)
   - Helper methods: email(), url(), uuid(), datetime(), date(), time(), etc.
   - nullable field support
   - uniqueItems for arrays
   - Schema metadata (title, schemaVersion)
   - Comprehensive documentation and tests

   Technical:
   - 116 tests passing (377 assertions)
   - PHPStan Level 9 compliant
   - PHP 8.2-8.4 compatible
   - Laravel 11-12 compatible"

   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

3. **Create GitHub Release**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/blaspsoft/forerunner/releases/new
   - Choose tag: `v0.1.0`
   - Release title: `v0.1.0 (Initial Pre-release)`
   - Check "This is a pre-release" box
   - Description:
     ```markdown
     # üöÄ Forerunner v0.1.0 - Initial Pre-release

     This is the **initial pre-release** version. We'll be iterating with 0.x versions as we gather feedback and add features before the 1.0.0 stable release.

## Stable Release (1.0.0) - Future

### When to Release 1.0.0

Release the stable version after:
- [ ] Pre-release has been tested by community (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] No critical bugs reported
- [ ] All feedback addressed
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and finalized

### Steps for 1.0.0 Release

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
   - Move changes from 0.9.0 to 1.0.0
   - Update date
   - Remove pre-release note
   - Add "First stable release" note

2. **Commit and tag**:
   ```bash
   git add CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0 - First stable release"
   git push origin main
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Create GitHub Release** (same process as pre-release, but without "pre-release" checkbox)

4. **Submit to Packagist**:
   - The package will auto-update via GitHub webhook
   - Verify at: https://packagist.org/packages/blaspsoft/forerunner

5. **Announce stable release**:
   - Update README badges if any
   - Social media announcements
   - Laravel News submission
   - Add to awesome-laravel lists

## Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

### Pre-1.0.0 Versions (Current: 0.x.x)
- **0.1.0** - Initial pre-release
- **0.2.0, 0.3.0, etc.** - New features, may include breaking changes
- **0.x.1, 0.x.2** - Bug fixes and patches

During the 0.x phase, we reserve the right to make breaking changes between minor versions (0.1 ‚Üí 0.2) as we refine the API based on feedback.

### Post-1.0.0 Versions (Future)
- **MAJOR** (1.x.x): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (x.1.x): New features, backwards compatible
- **PATCH** (x.x.1): Bug fixes, backwards compatible
